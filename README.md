Building this fxload command requires the tool CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ ) and you 
will need to run this build on either a Unix or Mac OS X system. 


All you need to do is

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create the fxload command in the build directory . From there 
you can manually copy it to /usr/bin ( or other location that is in 
your PATH ).
