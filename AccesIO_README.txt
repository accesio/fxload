This is the Acces I/O approved version of the fxload utilities. We have released these
to GitHub to ensure that the USB* family of products has a standardized utility 
capable of uploading firmware images.

One of the main reasons for this version hosted at GitHub was due to the variety of fxload
utilities that were present in the variety of Linux flavors on the market. We specfically 
needed to have the fx2lp functionality included in the utility and couldn't depend on 
a customer having different versions.

Sincerely,

The Acces I/O Team
